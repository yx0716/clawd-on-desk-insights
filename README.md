<<<<<<< HEAD
A desktop pet that reacts to your AI coding agent sessions in real-time. Clawd lives on your screen, scans local conversation history, and adds a RescueTime-style insights layer with AI-generated session summaries. Ships with two built-in themes: **Clawd** (pixel crab) and **Calico** (calico cat), with full support for custom themes.

Every conversation leaves an **imprint** — an idea you explored, a bug you solved, a decision you made. This tool makes those imprints visible.

A fork of [`rullerzhou-afk/clawd-on-desk`](https://github.com/rullerzhou-afk/clawd-on-desk) that keeps the desktop pet and adds an insights layer: scan local conversation history, visualize agent usage on a timeline, and generate AI summaries of what each session actually accomplished.

All data stays on your machine. Analysis runs through your own Claude Code or Codex CLI.
>>>>>>> f070cc1 (docs: add dashboard screenshots and rewrite README intro)

> Supports Windows 11, macOS, and Ubuntu/Linux. Requires Node.js. Works with **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, **Copilot CLI**, **Gemini CLI**, **Cursor Agent**, **Kiro CLI**, and **opencode**.

## Features

### Insights Dashboard
- **RescueTime-style timeline** — visualize sessions by day, duration, project, and agent in a dedicated analytics window
- **Local history scanning** — read Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Cursor Agent conversation files directly from your machine
- **Session-level AI review** — summarize each conversation from the user's point of view, including outcomes, topics, and time breakdown
- **Flexible analysis backends** — use local Claude Code, local Codex, or a configured API / Ollama fallback
- **Batch pre-analysis** — precompute recent session summaries and reuse provider-aware cached results in the dashboard
- **Quick access** — open the analytics dashboard from the tray menu or with `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Alt+A`

### Multi-Agent Support
- **Claude Code** — full integration via command hooks + HTTP permission hooks
- **Codex CLI** — automatic JSONL log polling (`~/.codex/sessions/`), no configuration needed
- **Copilot CLI** — command hooks via `~/.copilot/hooks/hooks.json`
- **Gemini CLI** — command hooks via `~/.gemini/settings.json` (registered automatically when Clawd starts, or run `npm run install:gemini-hooks`)
- **Cursor Agent** — [Cursor IDE hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks) in `~/.cursor/hooks.json` (registered automatically when Clawd starts, or run `npm run install:cursor-hooks`)
- **Kiro CLI** — command hooks injected into custom agent configs under `~/.kiro/agents/`, plus an auto-created `clawd` agent that is re-synced from Kiro's built-in `kiro_default` whenever Clawd starts, so you can opt into hooks with minimal behavior drift via `kiro-cli --agent clawd` or `/agent swap clawd` (registered automatically when Clawd starts, or run `npm run install:kiro-hooks`). State hooks have been verified on macOS.
- **opencode** — [plugin integration](https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins) via `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (registered automatically when Clawd starts); zero-latency event streaming, permission bubbles with Allow/Always/Deny, and building animations when parallel subagents are spawned via the `task` tool
- **Multi-agent coexistence** — run all agents simultaneously; Clawd tracks each session independently

### Animations & Interaction
- **Real-time state awareness** — agent hooks and log polling drive Clawd's animations automatically
- **12 animated states** — idle, thinking, typing, building, juggling, conducting, error, happy, notification, sweeping, carrying, sleeping
- **Eye tracking** — Clawd follows your cursor in idle state, with body lean and shadow stretch
- **Sleep sequence** — yawning, dozing, collapsing, sleeping after 60s idle; mouse movement triggers a startled wake-up animation
- **Click reactions** — double-click for a poke, 4 clicks for a flail
- **Drag from any state** — grab Clawd anytime (Pointer Capture prevents fast-flick drops), release to resume
- **Mini mode** — drag to right edge or right-click "Mini Mode"; Clawd hides at screen edge with peek-on-hover, mini alerts/celebrations, and parabolic jump transitions

### Permission Bubble
- **In-app permission review** — when Claude Code requests tool permissions, Clawd pops a floating bubble card instead of waiting in the terminal
- **Allow / Deny / Suggestions** — one-click approve, reject, or apply permission rules (e.g. "Always allow Read")
- **Global hotkeys** — `Ctrl+Shift+Y` to Allow, `Ctrl+Shift+N` to Deny the latest permission bubble (only registered while bubbles are visible)
- **Stacking layout** — multiple permission requests stack upward from the bottom-right corner
- **Auto-dismiss** — if you answer in the terminal first, the bubble disappears automatically

### Session Intelligence
- **Multi-session tracking** — sessions across all agents resolve to the highest-priority state
- **Subagent awareness** — juggling for 1 subagent, conducting for 2+
- **Terminal focus** — right-click Clawd → Sessions menu to jump to a specific session's terminal window; notification/attention states auto-focus the relevant terminal
- **Process liveness detection** — detects crashed/exited agent processes (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot) and cleans up orphan sessions
- **Startup recovery** — if Clawd restarts while any agent is running, it stays awake instead of falling asleep

### System
- **Click-through** — transparent areas pass clicks to windows below; only Clawd's body is interactive
- **Position memory** — Clawd remembers where you left it across restarts (including mini mode)
- **Single instance lock** — prevents duplicate Clawd windows
- **Auto-start** — Claude Code's SessionStart hook can launch Clawd automatically if it's not running
- **Do Not Disturb** — right-click or tray menu to enter sleep mode; all hook events are silenced until you wake Clawd. Permission bubbles are suppressed during DND — opencode falls back to its built-in TUI prompt, and Claude Code will handle permissions automatically
- **Sound effects** — short audio cues on task completion and permission requests (toggle via right-click menu; 10s cooldown, auto-muted during DND)
- **System tray** — resize (S/M/L), DND mode, language switch, auto-start, check for updates
- **i18n** — English and Chinese UI; switch via right-click menu or tray
- **Auto-update** — checks GitHub releases; Windows installs NSIS updates on quit, macOS/Linux `git pull` + restart when running from a cloned repo

## State Mapping

Events from all agents (Claude Code hooks, Codex JSONL, Copilot hooks) map to the same animation states:

| Agent Event | State | Animation | Clawd | Calico |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Idle (no activity) | idle | Eye-tracking follow | <img src="assets/gif/clawd-idle.gif" width="160"> | <img src="assets/gif/calico-idle.gif" width="130"> |
| Idle (random) | idle | Reading / patrol | <img src="assets/gif/clawd-idle-reading.gif" width="160"> | |

### Mini Mode

Drag to the right screen edge (or right-click → "Mini Mode") to enter mini mode — half-body visible at screen edge, peeking out on hover.

| Trigger | Mini Reaction | Clawd | Calico |
|---|---|---|---|
| Default | Breathing + blinking + eye tracking | <img src="assets/gif/clawd-mini-idle.gif" width="100"> | <img src="assets/gif/calico-mini-idle.gif" width="80"> |

| Task complete | Happy celebration | <img src="assets/gif/clawd-mini-happy.gif" width="100"> | <img src="assets/gif/calico-mini-happy.gif" width="80"> |

### Click Reactions

Easter eggs — try double-clicking, rapid 4-clicks, or poking Clawd repeatedly to discover hidden reactions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yx0716/clawd-on-desk-insights.git
cd clawd-on-desk-insights

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Clawd Insights (auto-registers Claude Code hooks on launch)
npm start
```

After launch, open the analytics dashboard from the tray menu or press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Alt+A`.

### Agent Setup

**Claude Code** — works out of the box. Hooks are auto-registered on launch. Versioned hooks (`PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `StopFailure`) are registered only when Clawd can positively detect a compatible Claude Code version; if detection fails (common for packaged macOS launches), Clawd falls back to core hooks and removes stale incompatible versioned hooks automatically.

**Codex CLI** — works out of the box. Clawd polls `~/.codex/sessions/` for JSONL logs automatically.

**Copilot CLI** — requires manual hook setup. See [docs/copilot-setup.md](docs/copilot-setup.md) for instructions.

**Kiro CLI** — run `npm run install:kiro-hooks` if you want hooks registered before launching Clawd. Kiro's built-in `kiro_default` agent is not backed by an editable JSON file, so Clawd creates a custom `clawd` agent and re-syncs it from the latest `kiro_default` each time Clawd starts, then appends hooks. Use `kiro-cli --agent clawd` for a new chat, or `/agent swap clawd` inside an existing Kiro session, when you want hooks enabled. On macOS, state-driven animations have been verified; native terminal permission prompts such as `t / y / n` still need to be answered in the terminal.

### Insights Setup

The analytics dashboard works locally and does not require a server. It reads local history from:

- `~/.claude/projects/`
- `~/.codex/sessions/`
- `~/.cursor/projects/`

For AI-generated session summaries, the app prefers a local `claude` or `codex` CLI. If neither is available, you can configure an API provider or Ollama as a fallback inside the app.

### Remote SSH (Claude Code & Codex CLI)

<img src="assets/screenshot-remote-ssh.png" width="560" alt="Remote SSH — permission bubble from Raspberry Pi">

Clawd can sense AI agent activity on remote servers via SSH reverse port forwarding. Hook events and permission requests travel through the SSH tunnel back to your local Clawd — no code changes needed on the Clawd side.

**One-click deploy:**

```bash
bash scripts/remote-deploy.sh user@remote-host
```

This copies hook files to the remote server, registers Claude Code hooks in remote mode, and prints SSH configuration instructions.

**SSH configuration** (add to your local `~/.ssh/config`):

```
Host my-server
    HostName remote-host
    User user
    RemoteForward 127.0.0.1:23333 127.0.0.1:23333
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

**How it works:**
- **Claude Code** — command hooks on the remote server POST state changes to `localhost:23333`, which the SSH tunnel forwards back to your local Clawd. Permission bubbles work too — the HTTP round-trip goes through the tunnel.
- **Codex CLI** — a standalone log monitor (`codex-remote-monitor.js`) polls JSONL files on the remote server and POSTs state changes through the same tunnel. Start it on the remote: `node ~/.claude/hooks/codex-remote-monitor.js --port 23333`

Remote hooks run in `CLAWD_REMOTE` mode which skips PID collection (remote PIDs are meaningless locally). Terminal focus is not available for remote sessions.

> Thanks to [@Magic-Bytes](https://github.com/Magic-Bytes) for the original SSH tunneling idea ([#9](https://github.com/rullerzhou-afk/clawd-on-desk/issues/9)).

### Sharing Trial Builds

For a quick same-platform trial build from your current machine:

```bash
npm run package:trial
```

Artifacts are written to `dist/`. For cross-platform artifacts from one branch, use the `Build & Release` GitHub Actions workflow. Manual runs upload artifacts only; `v*` tags publish a GitHub Release. See [docs/trial-sharing.md](docs/trial-sharing.md).

### macOS Notes

- **From source** (`npm start`): works out of the box on Intel and Apple Silicon.
- **DMG installer**: the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, so macOS Gatekeeper will block it. To open:
  - Right-click the app → **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog, or
  - Run `xattr -cr /Applications/Clawd\ on\ Desk\ Insights.app` in Terminal.

### Linux Notes

- **From source** (`npm start`): `--no-sandbox` is passed automatically to work around chrome-sandbox SUID requirements in dev mode.
- **Packages**: AppImage and `.deb` can be distributed from this repository's Releases page. After deb install, the app icon appears in GNOME's app menu.
- **Terminal focus**: uses `wmctrl` or `xdotool` (whichever is available). Install one for session terminal jumping to work: `sudo apt install wmctrl` or `sudo apt install xdotool`.
- **Auto-update**: when running from a cloned repo, "Check for Updates" performs `git pull` + `npm install` (if dependencies changed) and restarts the app automatically.

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| **Codex CLI: no terminal focus** | Codex sessions use JSONL log polling which doesn't carry terminal PID info. Clicking Clawd won't jump to the Codex terminal. Claude Code and Copilot CLI work fine. |
| **Insights scan coverage** | The analytics dashboard currently scans local histories from Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Cursor Agent. Copilot CLI and Gemini CLI still drive pet states, but their local conversation histories are not yet part of the dashboard scanner. |
| **Insights need a summarizer** | AI session summaries require a local `claude` or `codex` CLI, or a configured API / Ollama backend. Without one, the dashboard still shows timelines and raw session metadata. |
| **Codex CLI: Windows hooks disabled** | Codex hardcodes hooks off on Windows, so we poll log files instead. This means ~1.5s latency vs near-instant for hook-based agents. |
| **Copilot CLI: manual hook setup** | Copilot hooks require manually creating `~/.copilot/hooks/hooks.json`. Claude Code and Codex work out of the box. |
| **Copilot CLI: no permission bubble** | Copilot's `preToolUse` hook only supports deny, not the full allow/deny flow. Permission bubbles only work with Claude Code. |
| **Gemini CLI: no working state** | Gemini's session JSON only records completed messages, not in-progress tool execution. The pet jumps from thinking straight to happy/error — no typing animation during work. |
| **Gemini CLI: no permission bubble** | Gemini handles tool approval inside the terminal. File polling can't intercept or display approval requests. |
| **Gemini CLI: no terminal focus** | Session JSON doesn't carry terminal PID info, same limitation as Codex. |
| **Gemini CLI: polling latency** | ~1.5s poll interval + 4s defer window for batching tool completion signals. Noticeably slower than hook-based agents. |
| **Cursor Agent: no permission bubble** | Cursor handles permissions via stdout JSON in the hook, not HTTP blocking — Clawd can't intercept the approval flow. |
| **Cursor Agent: startup recovery** | No process detection on startup (matching the editor PID would false-trigger on any Cursor instance). Clawd stays idle until the first hook event fires. |
| **Kiro CLI: no session tracking** | Kiro CLI stdin JSON has no session_id — all Kiro sessions are merged into a single tracked session. |
| **Kiro CLI: no SessionEnd** | Kiro CLI has no session end event, so Clawd can't detect when a Kiro session ends. |
| **Kiro CLI: no subagent detection** | Kiro CLI has no subagent events, so juggling/conducting animations won't trigger. |
| **Kiro CLI: terminal permission prompts stay in terminal** | Kiro state hooks are verified on macOS, but when Kiro shows native terminal permission prompts such as `t / y / n`, those still need to be handled in the terminal. Clawd does not currently replace that flow. |
| **opencode: subtask menu clutter** | When opencode delegates to parallel subagents via the `task` tool, the subagent sessions briefly appear in the Sessions submenu while they run (5-8 seconds), then self-clean. Cosmetic only — the building animation fires correctly. |
| **opencode: terminal focus limited to spawning terminal** | The plugin runs in-process with opencode, so `source_pid` points to the terminal that launched opencode. If you use `opencode attach` from a different window, terminal focus jumps to the original launcher. |
| **macOS/Linux packaged auto-update** | DMG/AppImage/deb installs cannot auto-update — use `git clone` + `npm start` for auto-update via `git pull`, or download new versions manually from GitHub Releases. |
| **No test framework for Electron** | Unit tests cover agents and log polling, but the Electron main process (state machine, windows, tray) has no automated tests. |

## Custom Themes

Clawd supports custom themes — replace the default crab with your own character and animations.

**Quick start:**
1. Copy `themes/template/` to your themes directory:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%/clawd-on-desk/themes/my-theme/`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/clawd-on-desk/themes/my-theme/`
   - Linux: `~/.config/clawd-on-desk/themes/my-theme/`
2. Edit `theme.json` and create your assets (SVG, GIF, APNG, or WebP)
3. Right-click Clawd → Theme → select your theme

**Minimum viable theme:** 1 SVG (idle with eye tracking) + 7 GIF/APNG files (thinking, working, error, happy, notification, sleeping, waking). Eye tracking can be disabled to use any format for all states.

Validate your theme before distributing:
```bash
node scripts/validate-theme.js path/to/your-theme
```

See [docs/guide-theme-creation.md](docs/guide-theme-creation.md) for the full creation guide with tiered paths (beginner → advanced), `theme.json` field reference, and asset guidelines.

> Third-party SVG files are automatically sanitized for security.

### Roadmap

Some things we'd like to explore in the future:

- Codex terminal focus via process tree lookup from `codex.exe` PID
- Auto-registration of Copilot CLI hooks (like we do for Claude Code)
- Theme registry and in-app download
- Hook uninstall script for clean app removal
